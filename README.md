# Hello-World

For most of us, Creating a "Hello World" program is one of the first things we do as programmers.<br>
After we move on to learn more about the language, how often do we try to find unique ways to print hello world?<br>

Well, to be honest, I dont really care. This was done just for fun, and a way for me to tinker with some things I would otherwise rarely use.

Oh, also do note that it took my computer 3 minutes to run the program... go figure :P
